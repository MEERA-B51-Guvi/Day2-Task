    <h1>Write a blog on the Difference between document and window object?</h1>
    <h2><u><b>Document:</b></u></h2>
    <p>1. It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.<br>
       2.  It is loaded inside the window.<br>
        3. It is the object of window property.<br>
        4. All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.<br>
        5. We can access the document from a window using the window. document<br>
       6. The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)<br>
       7.  Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title<br>
        <b>Syntax:</b><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;document.propertyname;<br>
        <b>Example:</b><br>

       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; document.title :  will return the title of the document<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><u><b>Window:</b></u></h2>
    <p>1. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.<br>
    	
2. It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.<br>
3. It is the object of the browser.<br> 

4. Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.<br>
5. We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window<br>
6. The window is part of BOM, not DOM.<br>
7. Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.<br>
<b>Syntax:</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;window.propertyname;<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser</p>
